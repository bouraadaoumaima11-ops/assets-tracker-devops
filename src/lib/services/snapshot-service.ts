 * Persists today's NetWorthSnapshot for one user.

 * `getCachedNetWorthSummary`. The cron MUST pass it: it refreshes prices/FX and
 * materializes recurring rows, then revalidates `net-worth` / `prices` /
 * `exchange-rates` / `accounts` with `"max"` — stale-while-revalidate, so the
 * cached summary (tagged with exactly those tags) serves the PREVIOUS cycle's
 * numbers while the fresh value loads in the background. Snapshotting that read
 * shifted the whole persisted history one day (#640).
